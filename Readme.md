# 🛡️ Sentinel

### The AI agent can propose. Only your Move policy can approve. It can never rug you.

**An agent-native, key-safe DeFi treasury on Sui.**

> **Live on Sui mainnet and testnet,** with a hosted [web app](https://sentinel-clay-web.vercel.app/)
> you can try using a Google login - no wallet, no SUI required. **44 tests pass** (34 + 4 Move, 6 SDK).

## The problem

Letting an AI agent trade your funds means handing it your keys. One prompt injection, one buggy strategy, one rogue process - and the agent drains the wallet. Every "AI trading bot" is a custody time bomb.

## What Sentinel does

You fund a self-custodial **mandate wallet** and set human-readable rules - *max 0.5 SUI/day, allowed asset categories only, these DeepBook markets, expires in 30 days.* You switch on an AI agent that hunts yield and arbitrage on DeepBook. **The agent never holds a key.** It can only *propose* a trade. Every payment is gated by an on-chain Move policy that re-checks the mandate and consumes a one-shot authorization. An over-cap, wrong-market, or replayed trade **aborts on-chain** - provably, every time.

> Off-chain authorization is an optimization. On-chain Move is the law.

## The wow (watch the rogue agent get stopped)

| Step | What happens | Result | Status |
|------|--------------|--------|--------|
| – | Seal gates the witness secret: agent decrypts the authorization only if `seal_approve` passes; rogue intent denied | ⛔/✅ off-chain gate = on-chain law | **live** (predicate proven: `3mVozzJP…` / `DcUUFG8b…`) |
| 1 | Log in with Google (zkLogin), no wallet, no seed phrase; gas sponsored by Enoki | ✅ onboarded | **live in app** (Enoki + dapp-kit) |
| 2 | Set mandate (budget, stables, markets, expiry) → arm in one signature | ✅ on-chain shared `Mandate` | **live** |
| 3 | DeepSeek agent proposes a compliant trade → Approve | ✅ settles + fills, `PaymentSettled{base_out}` | **live on real DeepBook v3** (0.5 SUI → 20 DEEP, `5SMBQo8B…`) |
| 4 | Tampered agent attempts an over-cap trade | ⛔ aborts on-chain `E_OVER_CAP` | **live on testnet** (`DcUUFG8b…`) |
| 5 | Agent replays a used authorization | ⛔ aborts on-chain `E_REPLAY` | **live on testnet** |
| 6 | Open the Walrus audit log | 🔍 every proposal+verdict, immutable on Walrus | **live in app** (Seal-encrypted blobs) |

Real testnet transactions (committed, explorer-visible): **real DeepBook fill** `5SMBQo8B…`
(0.5 SUI → 20 DEEP); `seal_approve` compliant `3mVozzJP…`; over-cap abort `E_OVER_CAP` `DcUUFG8b…`;
`E_REPLAY` `3aNnknYg…`. The **same policy is also published on Sui mainnet** (current `0x71ca3a5c…`,
with the recipient binding); an earlier mainnet deploy proved the compliant settle + over-cap abort
(`2z8CxQ6C…` / `6JWnSZKX…`). Full transcript in [DEPLOYMENTS.md](DEPLOYMENTS.md).

            DeepBook v3 (fill)                          Walrus (Seal-encrypted audit blob)
```

**The core invariant:** the *same* predicate logic gates both the off-chain Seal key-server dry-run and the on-chain `payment::pay` enforcement - they share code. A verdict released off-chain that violates the mandate is impossible to *settle* on-chain, because the Move contract re-checks and aborts. We prove this with a differential test (see [Security](#security)).

### Sui Stack used

| Primitive | Role in Sentinel |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Move (Sui)** | Mandate object, dry-runnable `seal_approve` predicate, one-shot `Witness` resource (no `copy`/`drop`/`store`), atomic check-rotate-transfer |
| **Seal** | Threshold encryption gates **release of the one-shot witness secret**: `seal_approve` (same `policy::check` as `pay`) decides whether key servers release the preimage; rogue intent denied off-chain + re-aborted on-chain. Also encrypts the audit log (owner-only). _wired in `sdk/`; on-chain predicate proven live_ |
| **DeepBook v3** | On-chain trade execution venue; the agent reads live mid/quote via dev-inspect |
| **Walrus** | Immutable audit log - every proposal+verdict is a Seal-encrypted blob (testnet publisher/aggregator). _live in app_ |
| **zkLogin + Enoki sponsored tx** | Google login, no seed phrase, gas sponsored - judge needs no wallet/SUI. _live in app (dapp-kit + @mysten/enoki)_ |
| **DeepSeek agent** | The keyless "Yield Hunter" (shared brain in `sdk/proposer`) proposes trades with plain-English rationale; never holds a key. Runs on demand (`/api/agent`) and as an autonomous 24/7 worker (`agent/`, deployable to Render) that streams proposals to an Upstash feed the app renders live |
| **Nautilus** *(stretch)* | Agent strategy in a TEE so proposals are provably from the attested binary; on-chain ed25519 verifier module shipped + tested (`nautilus/`), live AWS Nitro deploy is the last mile. See [how it works](docs/architecture.md#nautilus-provable-agent-strategy) |

## Move highlights (for reviewers)

- **`Witness`** has no `copy`, no `drop`, no `store` - Move's type system enforces one-shot authorization at **compile time**. It cannot be duplicated, silently dropped, or stashed for replay.
- **`seal_approve` and `payment::pay` call the identical `policy::check`** - off-chain authorization can never diverge from on-chain enforcement.
- **Atomic check → rotate witness commitment → execute**, all in one Programmable Transaction Block; any violation reverts the whole transaction.

## Security

**`sui move test` → 34 passed, 0 failed** (sentinel) · **4 passed** (`nautilus/` enclave verifier, ed25519 vs RFC 8032) · **`pnpm test` (sdk) → 6 passed** (keccak↔Move parity, `seal_id` codec).

| Property | Test | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| `spent_today ≤ daily_cap` always | `invariant_spent_never_exceeds_cap` (200 randomized) | ✅ |
| A consumed witness never re-validates (replay) | `replayed_witness_aborts` → `E_REPLAY` | ✅ |
| `nonce` strictly monotonic + commitment rotates | `invariant_nonce_monotonic_and_rotates` | ✅ |
| Forged witness rejected | `forged_witness_aborts` → `E_BAD_WITNESS` | ✅ |
| Revoked/expired mandate settles nothing | `authorize_on_revoked_mandate_aborts` | ✅ |
| `seal_approve` ⇔ `payment::pay` share one check | `differential_compliant_seal_and_authorize_agree` | ✅ |
| No compliant-rejection / no violating-acceptance | `fuzz_evaluate_matches_spec` (400 random intents) | ✅ |
| Proceeds can't be redirected (recipient bound to owner) | `authorize_wrong_recipient_aborts` → `E_RECIPIENT` | ✅ |
| Every abort code (`E_OVER_CAP`…`E_RECIPIENT`) | dedicated unit tests | ✅ |

Fresh Package ID per checkpoint during development; full history + runtime object IDs and the
live abort/replay tx digests are in [DEPLOYMENTS.md](DEPLOYMENTS.md).

## Repo layout
```
sentinel/   Move package (mandate · policy · payment · seal_policy · execution) + vendored deepbook
nautilus/   Move package (stretch): enclave attestation/authorship verifier (ed25519) + tests
sdk/        TypeScript: AuthorizationProvider (LocalWitness + Seal), PaymentClient, SealAuditLog,
            proposer (shared keyless Yield Hunter brain)
agent/      Standalone always-on worker: ticks, hunts DeepBook, streams proposals (Upstash) - no key
web/        Next.js app - landing, mandate builder, keyless agent, settle, Walrus audit
```

## Run it locally
```bash
# Move package - DeepBook is vendored (vendor/deepbook, corrected Published.toml) so a fresh clone
# builds + links to live testnet DeepBook with NO --allow-dirty and no cache edits.
cd sentinel && sui move build && sui move test          # 34 passed

# Whole workspace (sdk + web)
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @sentinel/sdk test                         # 6 passed (keccak↔Move parity, seal_id codec)
pnpm --filter web dev                                    # → http://localhost:3000
```
Without any keys the app runs on a **self-custodial demo wallet** (browser keypair + faucet) and the
agent uses a deterministic heuristic - so it works end-to-end out of the box. Add the keys below to
switch on Google/zkLogin onboarding and the DeepSeek agent.

### Environment (`web/.env.local`; see `web/.env.example`)
| Var | Purpose | Where |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENOKI_API_KEY` / `ENOKI_SECRET_KEY` | zkLogin + sponsored gas | [portal.enoki.mystenlabs.com](https://portal.enoki.mystenlabs.com) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth (register it in Enoki too) | [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | the Yield Hunter agent (server-only) | [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com) |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | autonomous agent proposal feed (server-only); `agent/` writes, app reads | [upstash.com](https://upstash.com) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTINEL_PKG`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_REGISTRY` | on-chain ids (defaults shipped) | - |

> **Deploying to Vercel:** set these in **Project → Settings → Environment Variables** (`.env.local`
> is local-only and gitignored), then redeploy. Add your Vercel URL to the Google OAuth origins and the
> Enoki project's allowed origins. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORCE_LOCAL=1` forces the demo wallet for local dev.

## Demo path
Google login (no wallet/SUI) → set mandate → **arm** (sponsored, one signature) → faucet a little
trade-SUI → agent **proposes** a DeepBook trade → **Approve** → settles + fills → **tampered agent**
over-cap → aborts `E_OVER_CAP` → **replay** → aborts `E_REPLAY` → **Activity** shows the Walrus audit trail.

## What's next
- **Live AWS Nitro enclave** for the agent strategy - the on-chain ed25519 verifier and the mock-attestation path already ship (see [how it works](docs/architecture.md#nautilus-provable-agent-strategy)); the remaining step is the hardware attestation itself.
- **Multi-asset mandate vault** (Model B) - hold and trade several assets under one mandate.
- **Walrus Site + SuiNS** - host the frontend fully on-chain under a Sui name.
